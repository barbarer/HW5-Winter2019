# HW5-Winter2019
In this homework you will be debugging code that reads from a file and creates a dictory for each line of data from the file (other than the first line). 

See Homework 5 Instructions.pdf for the detailed instructions and grading rubric.

The code is in homework5.py.

It reads from the file H5Data.csv.  Be sure to run from the directory with this file so that Python can find the data file.

- Clicking on the link forked this repository to your account on github.  
- Clone the repository to your local computer.
- Edit homework5.py.  You can commit out most of the test cases using triple double quotes and then just get one thing working at a time.  Then add the changed file to the staging area and commit the changes.  
- When you are done with all your changes push back to your github repository.
- Add the URL to your github repository on Canvas.
