# HW5-Winter2019
In this homework you will be debugging code that reads from a file and creates a dictionary for each line of data from the file (other than the first line). Each dictionary is appended to a list of dictionaries.  

See Homework 5 Instructions.pdf for the detailed instructions and grading rubric.

The code is in homework5.py.

The code reads from the file H5Data.csv.  Be sure to run this source from the directory with this data file so that Python can find the data file.
